            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is James Porter. I have previously been employed as a professional software developer for
                the past 14 years. After my last assignment ended, I decided to return to college to update my
                development skills as well as learn new ones, as a lot has changed over the past decade.</p>
            <p>Share your background, interests, goals, or anything that helps define who you are as a person or
                student.</p>

            <h3>Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>I consider this journey a reboot as we sometimes have to relearn the new basics before continuing to
                advanced topics. It is my intention to become a better software/web developer the right way so I can
                bring value to my future clients or company.</p>
            <p>Introduce either your real self as a future web professional or the avatar you've chosen for this course.

        <section id="journey">
            <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>By returning to school, I am embracing continuous learning. My focus is on refreshing my foundation while
                also staying up to date with modern frameworks, tools, and best practices that will help me succeed in
                today's fast-paced technology environment.</p>
            <p>Reflect on why you're taking this course, what you're hoping to gain, and what kinds of projects or
                skills you want to explore.</p>
