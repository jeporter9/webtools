        <section>
            <h3 id="about" class="scroll-stop">About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>James Porter</strong>. I have worked as a professional software developer for
                fourteen years. Much of my career has been spent building web applications and supporting teams in
                different industries. Over time, I have come to value both the technical side of programming and the
                teamwork that makes projects successful. My work has taken me across multiple domains, from business
                systems to customer-facing websites, and each project has taught me how diverse and exciting the field
                of software truly is.</p>
            <p>When my last assignment ended, I decided to return to college to refresh my skills. Technology
                changes
                quickly, and what was advanced a decade ago is often outdated now. <em>Continuous learning</em> is
                necessary in this field. By returning to school, I can combine my professional experience with new
                tools
                and practices. This balance will help me stay relevant in an industry that thrives on innovation. I
                am
                excited to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and techniques while sharpening the
                problem-solving skills that have guided me throughout my career.</p>

                    <a href="images/about-me.png" target="_blank">

                    <figcaption>James Porter Avatar</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Because of my background, I also understand deadlines, collaboration, and quality work. I believe
                    revisiting the classroom gives me the chance to rebuild my foundation and merge it with my past
                    experience for a stronger approach to development. This step feels less like starting over and more
                    like
                    evolving into a more complete version of myself as a developer.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 id="identity" class="scroll-stop">Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>I see myself as more than someone who writes code. I am a problem solver, communicator, and learner. A
                developerâ€™s identity is shaped not only by technical knowledge but also by the ability to adapt, work
                with others, and build solutions that add real value. My identity as a developer includes patience when
                solving tough problems and creativity when searching for new approaches. These qualities define who I am
                as much as my technical skill set.</p>

            <div class="clearfix bordered-box">
                <figure class="figure-left">
                    <a href="images/imgdeveloper3.png" target="_blank">
                        <img src="images/imgdeveloper3-md.png" class="fluid-image" alt="James Porter Avatar">
                    </a>
                </figure>
                <p>I view this stage of my career as a <strong>reboot</strong>. It gives me the chance to review the
                    basics
                    and strengthen them before moving to more advanced topics. My long-term goal is to become a reliable
                    and
                    well-rounded developer who can contribute to both clients and companies. I believe a strong
                    developer
                    identity comes from curiosity, openness to feedback, and dedication to lifelong improvement. With
                    these
                    values, I can grow into a developer who balances technical depth with human connection.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="journey" class="scroll-stop">Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>My learning journey is focused on curiosity and persistence. I want to explore new languages, frameworks,
                and tools, while also understanding timeless ideas such as algorithms, clean code, and good design.
                Frameworks may change, but principles like <em>user experience</em> remain constant. I aim to strengthen
                my foundation while gradually moving into specialized areas that interest me, such as full-stack
                development and cloud computing.</p>

            <div class="clearfix bordered-box">
                <figure class="figure-right">
                    <a href="images/learning-journey.png" target="_blank">

                    </a>
                </figure>
                <p>College offers me structure, guidance, and peers to learn with. Collaboration is key, since sharing
                    knowledge and working in groups helps everyone grow. I also want to improve soft skills like
                    communication and leadership, which are important for teamwork and future opportunities. By learning
                    how
                    to clearly explain technical concepts, I can bridge gaps between technical and non-technical team
                    members and create smoother collaboration.</p>
