            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>James Porter</strong>. I have worked as a professional software developer for
                fourteen years. Much of my career has been spent building web applications and supporting teams in
                different industries. Over time, I have come to value both the technical side of programming and the
                teamwork that makes projects successful. My work has taken me across multiple domains, from business
                systems to customer-facing websites, and each project has taught me how diverse and exciting the field
                of software truly is.</p>

            <p>When my last assignment ended, I decided to return to college to refresh my skills. Technology changes
                quickly, and what was advanced a decade ago is often outdated now. <em>Continuous learning</em> is
                necessary in this field. By returning to school, I can combine my professional experience with new tools
                and practices. This balance will help me stay relevant in an industry that thrives on innovation. I am
                excited to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and techniques while sharpening the
                problem-solving skills that have guided me throughout my career.</p>

            <p>Because of my background, I also understand deadlines, collaboration, and quality work. I believe
                revisiting the classroom gives me the chance to rebuild my foundation and merge it with my past
                experience for a stronger approach to development. This step feels less like starting over and more like
                evolving into a more complete version of myself as a developer.</p>

        <section id="identity">
            <h3>Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>I see myself as more than someone who writes code. I am a problem solver, communicator, and learner. A
                developerâ€™s identity is shaped not only by technical knowledge but also by the ability to adapt, work
                with others, and build solutions that add real value. My identity as a developer includes patience when
                solving tough problems and creativity when searching for new approaches. These qualities define who I am
                as much as my technical skill set.</p>

            <p>I view this stage of my career as a <strong>reboot</strong>. It gives me the chance to review the basics
                and strengthen them before moving to more advanced topics. My long-term goal is to become a reliable and
                well-rounded developer who can contribute to both clients and companies. I believe a strong developer
                identity comes from curiosity, openness to feedback, and dedication to lifelong improvement. With these
                values, I can grow into a developer who balances technical depth with human connection.</p>

        <section id="journey">
            <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>My learning journey is focused on curiosity and persistence. I want to explore new languages, frameworks,
                and tools, while also understanding timeless ideas such as algorithms, clean code, and good design.
                Frameworks may change, but principles like <em>user experience</em> remain constant. I aim to strengthen
                my foundation while gradually moving into specialized areas that interest me, such as full-stack
                development and cloud computing.</p>

            <p>College offers me structure, guidance, and peers to learn with. Collaboration is key, since sharing
                knowledge and working in groups helps everyone grow. I also want to improve soft skills like
                communication and leadership, which are important for teamwork and future opportunities. By learning how
                to clearly explain technical concepts, I can bridge gaps between technical and non-technical team
                members and create smoother collaboration.</p>
