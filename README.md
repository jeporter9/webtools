# My WebTools Class Project

My project involves HTML and CSS. You can check out the pages here: [Web Tools Project](https://jeporter9.github.io/webtools/). Feel free to explore, and let me know how we can collaborate!

I used ChatGPT to help build this website, particularly for crafting a clear and engaging introduction, as well as designing my programmer avatar.
