# My WebTools Class Project

My project involves HTML and CSS. You can check out the pages here: [Web Tools Project](https://jeporter9.github.io/webtools/). Feel free to explore, and let me know how we can collaborate!

I used ChatGPT to help build this website, particularly for crafting a clear and engaging introduction, as well as designing my programmer avatar.  I have also used CoPilot to help autocomplete semantec tags and css.

w3.css updates:
- I updated my Products page with cards (had to update some of my CSS to perform better with them); I also styled the buttons with w3.css.

- On my About-Us page, I updated the list with the w3-ul & w3-border classes. The w3-ul class was also applied to the footer and sidebar lists as well.

- On my Team page, I applied the w3-theme-blue theme to the position headers.

- On my Contact-Us page, all of the input controls were updated with the appropriate w3 class (w3-input, w3-select, w3-check, w3-radio, etc.).

- On my Success page with my table on it, I applied the w3-theme-blue to it.  With regards to the table, I used the classes w3-responsive, w3-table-all, w3-large,  w3-hoverable along with w3-hover-{color} for each table row (made it more readable).
