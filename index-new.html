            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>James Porter</strong>. I have worked as a professional software developer for
                fourteen years. Much of my career has been spent building web applications and supporting teams in
                different industries. Over time, I have come to value both the technical side of programming and the
                teamwork that makes projects successful. My work has taken me across multiple domains, from business
                systems to customer-facing websites, and each project has taught me how diverse and exciting the field
                of software truly is.</p>

            <p>When my last assignment ended, I decided to return to college to refresh my skills. Technology changes
                quickly, and what was advanced a decade ago is often outdated now. <em>Continuous learning</em> is
                necessary in this field. By returning to school, I can combine my professional experience with new tools
                and practices. This balance will help me stay relevant in an industry that thrives on innovation. I am
                excited to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and techniques while sharpening the
                problem-solving skills that have guided me throughout my career.</p>

            <p>Because of my background, I also understand deadlines, collaboration, and quality work. I believe
                revisiting the classroom gives me the chance to rebuild my foundation and merge it with my past
                experience for a stronger approach to development. This step feels less like starting over and more like
                evolving into a more complete version of myself as a developer.</p>

        <section id="identity">
            <h2>Developer Identity</h2>
            <p>I see myself as more than someone who writes code. I am a problem solver, communicator, and learner. A
                developerâ€™s identity is shaped not only by technical knowledge but also by the ability to adapt, work
                with others, and build solutions that add real value. My identity as a developer includes patience when
                solving tough problems and creativity when searching for new approaches. These qualities define who I am
                as much as my technical skill set.</p>

            <p>I view this stage of my career as a <strong>reboot</strong>. It gives me the chance to review the basics
                and strengthen them before moving to more advanced topics. My long-term goal is to become a reliable and
                well-rounded developer who can contribute to both clients and companies. I believe a strong developer
                identity comes from curiosity, openness to feedback, and dedication to lifelong improvement. With these
                values, I can grow into a developer who balances technical depth with human connection.</p>

            <p>I also connect development to both science and art. As <cite>Donald Knuth</cite> once said, science is
                what we can explain to a computer, and art is everything else. This idea reminds me that programming
                requires precision and creativity. Keeping both in mind helps me solve problems in thoughtful ways. For
                me, embracing both science and art allows technology to serve people in meaningful and practical ways.

        <section id="journey">
            <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>My learning journey is focused on curiosity and persistence. I want to explore new languages, frameworks,
                and tools, while also understanding timeless ideas such as algorithms, clean code, and good design.
                Frameworks may change, but principles like <em>user experience</em> remain constant. I aim to strengthen
                my foundation while gradually moving into specialized areas that interest me, such as full-stack
                development and cloud computing.</p>

            <p>College offers me structure, guidance, and peers to learn with. Collaboration is key, since sharing
                knowledge and working in groups helps everyone grow. I also want to improve soft skills like
                communication and leadership, which are important for teamwork and future opportunities. By learning how
                to clearly explain technical concepts, I can bridge gaps between technical and non-technical team
                members and create smoother collaboration.</p>

            <p>I plan to track my progress by writing, contributing to open-source projects, and building a portfolio.
                This will keep me accountable and allow me to inspire others on similar paths. Each step brings me
                closer to being a dependable and creative developer. By embracing lifelong learning, I will stay
                adaptable no matter how fast technology changes. I see this journey not only as a professional path but
                also as a personal one, shaping the way I solve problems, work with others, and continue growing over
                time.</p>
